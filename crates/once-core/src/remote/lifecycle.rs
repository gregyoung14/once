//! Durable ownership of hosted sandboxes.
//!
//! Every create is journaled under the workspace's `.once/executors` runtime
//! state before its request is sent and tagged with a unique operation marker
//! in provider metadata. The provider id is journaled as soon as it is known,
//! and the record is removed only after a confirmed deletion. Records left by
//! a lost create response, a failed deletion, or a process exit are repaired by
//! [`reconcile`] on a later run, which deletes only sandboxes that an
//! authenticated lookup currently reports with the record's marker.
//!
//! This bounds orphaned cost; it is not a hard bound on the provider fleet,
//! which can still outlive a lost journal, a relabelled sandbox, or a provider
//! that ignores deletion. The journal holds a fixed number of records and
//! refuses new creates when full. Records that cannot be resolved, such as
//! those created under a credential or endpoint that is no longer configured,
//! are kept and occupy that capacity until the original access returns or the
//! records are removed by hand.
