//! Each local action runs as the leader of its own process group, so stopping
//! the action stops everything it started, not just the direct child.
//!
//! [`GroupChild`] owns the spawned leader and keeps it unreaped until the
//! action is done with its group: leader exit is observed without reaping it,
//! so the zombie leader stays a member of the group and the group id cannot be
//! reused while Once may still signal it. Only [`GroupChild::reap`] reaps: it
//! waits for the leader to exit with the group still registered, kills what
//! is left of the group, then unregisters it and reaps. Dropping the handle
//! before that
//! (cancellation, a timeout, a capture error) sends `SIGKILL` to the group and
//! unregisters it before the leader can be reaped.
//!
//! Live groups are recorded in the [`registry`], which a termination handler
//! walks through [`signal_action_process_groups`].
